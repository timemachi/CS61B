The naive implementation was maintaining a record of every single connection. Improvements
made were:
- Keeping track of sets rather than connections (QuickFind)
- Tracking set membership by recording parent not set # (QuickUnion)
- Union by Size (WeightedQuickUnion)
- Path Compression (WeightedQuickUnionWithPathCompression)
union by size and path compression
